# Decisions

* Decisions will be made by a majority vote, with the product owner having the final say in the event of a tie.

# Attendance

* We expect members to attend all scheduled meetings unless they have a legitimate reason for missing, such as illness, family emergencies, or prior commitments.
Members who miss meetings should promptly communicate the reason for their absence to the team and make an effort to catch up on what was discussed.

# Assignments

* Assignments will be made based on individual strengths and interests, as well as workload distribution.
* If a member fails to complete or poorly completes an assignment, the team will work together to understand the reasons and offer assistance if needed.
Participation#

* We will honor each member's strengths and interests by involving them in tasks aligned with their skills.
Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums#

* Meeting times and locations will be determined through communication on Discord or text to find a suitable arrangement for all members.

# Agenda and Minutes/Notes

* Meeting minutes/notes will be taken by a rotating member during each meeting. Minutes will be shared in a shared document accessible to all team members.

# Promptness

* We expect all members to be punctual for meetings. If a member anticipates being late, they should notify the team in advance.

# Conversational Courtesies

In discussions, we will promote respectful dialogue and provide space for all members to express their opinions.
