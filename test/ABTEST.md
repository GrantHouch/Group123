**A/B Test Name:** School RAM Logo on Home Screen
**User Story Number:** US1
**Metric (from the HEART grid):** Engagement

**Hypothesis:**
The problem we want to solve is that our user engagement on the home screen is lower than desired, and we suspect that adding our school's RAM Logo might enhance user engagement. The impact of this problem is that a higher engagement rate on the home screen could lead to increased user satisfaction and potentially boost user retention and conversion rates.

**Hypothesis Statement:**
"Adding our school's RAM Logo to the home screen will increase user engagement, as users will be more likely to recognize and connect with our brand, resulting in a higher interaction rate with the content on the home screen."

**Hypothesis Variables:**
- **Control Group (Group A):** Home screen without the RAM Logo.
- **Experimental Group (Group B):** Home screen with the RAM Logo.

Now, let's plan how to measure the results and define success metrics:

**Success Metrics:**
1. **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** We will measure the percentage of users in each group who click on elements on the home screen. This will help us understand if the presence of the RAM Logo influences user interaction.

2. **Time Spent on Home Screen:** We will track the average time users from each group spend on the home screen. An increase in time spent indicates higher engagement.

3. **User Feedback:** Collect qualitative feedback from users in both groups to gauge their perception of the home screen with or without the RAM Logo. This can be done through surveys or user interviews.

4. **Conversion Rate:** Measure whether the addition of the RAM Logo has a positive impact on user conversion rates, such as signing up for an account or exploring more features. This metric indirectly relates to engagement and user satisfaction.

**Implementation:**
Randomly assign new users to either Group A (Control) or Group B (Experimental) when they access the home screen. Ensure that the RAM Logo is displayed consistently for users in Group B throughout the test period.

**Data Analysis:**
At the end of the test period, analyze the collected data to determine whether the presence of the RAM Logo on the home screen had a statistically significant impact on user engagement. Use appropriate statistical tests to compare the success metrics between the two groups.

If the experimental group (Group B) shows a significant improvement in engagement compared to the control group (Group A), we can conclude that adding the school's RAM Logo is beneficial. If not, we may need to reconsider the logo's placement, design, or other factors affecting engagement.
